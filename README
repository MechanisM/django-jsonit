JSONit is a set of helpers for working with JSON responses in Django.  It
defines a uniform structure for your JSON responses and provides HttpResponse
subclasses, middleware, class-based view mixins, and more to ease the process
of integrating with your front-end code.  It requires no formal installation.
Simply import the helper you need and go.
